# added Coins to Wallet in Character constructor
# created no requirement Door with match_key == NULL, fixed seg fault
# made Area::description() virtual so Shop::description() can print
content of "vector<Object*> goods"
# created Shop to test buy/sell
# buy works correctly
# sell does not return correct value, this is because of Wallet::operator-=
# int weight and volume for all the derived Coins were not set since
derived default constructor did not call base constructor, so random values
were initialized which caused some of the Coins not to be added at
logic Container::hold_weight() or Container::hold_volume()
# fixed: Key did not set weight and volume
# added random descr for Key
# valgrind gives "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised
values at Container::add(Object*). Solution was to set weight and
volume = 0 in Object default constructor since in
Container::add(Object*) there is an if(weight > foo || volume > foo)
# fixed memory leak in Shop constructor: goods = new Ground();
# fixed memory leaks in Level constructor: opmap = new ...Op...;
# changed Character::view_inventory to show objects in all containers
# added Character::view_curContainer, Character::change_curContainer
# changed Character::pick_up and Character::drop to use "curContainer"
instead of "inventory"
# in Character::buy(string) and Character::sell(string) now uses
dynamic_cast to check if "curArea" is a class Shop, hence no need to
have Area::buy(string) and Area::sell(string), enough with
Shop::buy(string) and Shop::sell(string)
# added Container::contents(), added Container::get_subContainers()
# added Character::move_obj("name", "source", "destination")
# added in operation.h: CharOpBool3String, arguments are separated with |
# changed Level::add(Character*) to add appendix if name collision
# changed in game_debug.cpp: split(string) to more general function
with delimiter choice

since 201107**
# made Wallet and Ground private classes in Character and Area respectively

since 20110703
fixed so that a Character blocking a road was not added to global
players (cannot be given commands)???
